						CANDELS</b><br>Wrote
						pipeline script to
						reduce multi-object
						spectroscopic data
						from the Gemini North
						Telescope to measure
						redshifts of observed
						galaxies. Currently
						flux calibrating data
						to perform science
						analysis using
						emission line fluxes (2016-ongoing).
							</p>
							<p>
								<b>Brighest
						Cluster Galaxies
						Identified as Possibly
						Undergoing Star
						Formation</b><br> Performed a multiwavelength analysis of a sample of Brightest Cluster Galaxies. Analysis included working with spectroscopic and photometric data to extract star formation rates and other properties of galaxies. Mentored by Dr. Stefi Baum and Dr. Chris Oâ€™Dea (2014-2016).

								<b>ELF:
						A Python Program to
						Extract Information
						from Optical Emission
						Line Fluxes</b><br>Designed and implemented Python program to classify a list of galaxies inputted by coordinates using spectral emission line features from spectroscopy taken as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Independently designed project (2015-2016).
